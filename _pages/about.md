My research focuses on advancing sustainability and intelligence in the built environment through the integration of computational design, digital technologies, and environmental performance analysis. I explore how emerging tools—including the Internet of Things (IoT), extended reality (XR), and AI-enhanced design systems—can support climate-responsive architecture, optimize building performance, and enhance occupant-centered design processes.

By bridging architectural engineering, data-driven methodologies, and human–environment interactions, my work aims to develop low-impact, future-oriented design strategies for resilient and intelligent buildings.
